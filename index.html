        <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.</p>
      <p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.</p>
      <p>Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996. It promised write once, run anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification. With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 â€“ 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.</p>
      <p>Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming language since then.[18] Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub.[19] Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Java JVM and bytecode</li>
          <p>One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate run time support. This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. End-users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their device for standalone Java applications or a web browser for Java applets.</p>
          <p>Standard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, threading, and networking.</p>
          <p>The use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine instructions made interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native executables. Just-in-time (JIT) compilers that compile byte-codes to machine code during runtime were introduced from an early stage. Java's Hotspot compiler is actually two compilers in one; and with GraalVM (included in e.g. Java 11, but removed as of Java 16) allowing tiered compilation. Java itself is platform-independent and is adapted to the particular platform it is to run on by a Java virtual machine (JVM), which translates the Java bytecode into the platform's machine language.</p>
          <li>Performance</li>
          <p>Programs written in Java have a reputation for being slower and requiring more memory than those written in C++. However, Java programs' execution speed improved significantly with the introduction of just-in-time compilation in 1997/1998 for Java 1.1, the addition of language features supporting better code analysis (such as inner classes, the StringBuilder class, optional assertions, etc.), and optimizations in the Java virtual machine, such as HotSpot becoming Sun's default JVM in 2000. With Java 1.5, the performance was improved with the addition of the <code class='internal'>java.util.concurrent</code> package, including lock-free implementations of the ConcurrentMaps and other multi-core collections, and it was improved further with Java 1.6.</p>
          <li>Non-JVM</li>
          <p>Some platforms offer direct hardware support for Java; there are micro controllers that can run Java bytecode in hardware instead of a software Java virtual machine, and some ARM-based processors could have hardware support for executing Java bytecode through their Jazelle option, though support has mostly been dropped in current implementations of ARM.</p>
          <li>Automatic memory management</li>
          <p>Java uses an automatic garbage collector to manage memory in the object lifecycle. The programmer determines when objects are created, and the Java runtime is responsible for recovering the memory once objects are no longer in use. Once no references to an object remain, the unreachable memory becomes eligible to be freed automatically by the garbage collector. Something similar to a memory leak may still occur if a programmer's code holds a reference to an object that is no longer needed, typically when objects that are no longer needed are stored in containers that are still in use. If methods for a non-existent object are called, a null pointer exception is thrown.</p>
          <p>Java does not support C/C++ style pointer arithmetic, where object addresses can be arithmetically manipulated (e.g. by adding or subtracting an offset). This allows the garbage collector to relocate referenced objects and ensures type safety and security.</p>
          <p>As in C++ and some other object-oriented languages, variables of Java's primitive data types are either stored directly in fields (for objects) or on the stack (for methods) rather than on the heap, as is commonly true for non-primitive data types (but see escape analysis). This was a conscious decision by Java's designers for performance reasons.</p>
          <p>Java contains multiple types of garbage collectors. Since Java 9, HotSpot uses the Garbage First Garbage Collector (G1GC) as the default. However, there are also several other garbage collectors that can be used to manage the heap. For most applications in Java, G1GC is sufficient. Previously, the Parallel Garbage Collector was used in Java 8.</p>

        <header>Getting Started</header>
          <p>Some PCs might have Java already installed. To check if you have Java installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Java or type the following in Command Prompt (cmd.exe):</p>
          <code>C:\Users\Your Name>java -version</code>
          <p>If Java is installed, you will see something like this (depending on version):</p>
          <code>java version "22.0.0" 2024-08-21 LTS</code><br>
          <code>Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 22.9 (build 22.0.0+13-LTS)</code><br>
          <code>Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 22.9 (build 22.0.0+13-LTS, mixed mode)</code>

        <header>The main Method</header>
          <p>The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:</p>
          <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>
          <p>Any code inside the main() method will be executed. Don't worry about the keywords before and after it. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.</p>
          <p>For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.</p>

          <p>Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:</p>
          <code>public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Hello World");
}</code>

        <header>Java Variables</header>
          <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
          <p>In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class='list_variables'>String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes</li>
            <li class='list_variables'>int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
            <li class='list_variables'>float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
            <li class='list_variables'>char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
            <li class='list_variables'>boolean - stores values with two states: true or false</li>
          </ul>

      <section class='main-section' id='Declaring_Variables'>
        <header>Declaring Variables</header>
          <p>To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:</p>
          <code>type variableName = value;</code>
          <p>Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.</p>
          <p>To create a variable that should store text, look at the following example:</p>
          <p><b>Example:</b> Create a variable called name of type String and assign it the value "John". Then we use println() to print the name variable:</p>
          <code>String name = "John";</code><br>
          <code>System.out.println(name);</code>
          <p>To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:</p>
          <p><b>Example:</b> Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15:</p>
          <code>int myNum = 15;</code><br>
          <code>System.out.println(myNum);</code>
          <p>You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later:</p>
          <p><b>Example:</b></p>
          <code>int myNum;</code><br>
          <code>myNum = 15;</code><br>
          <code>System.out.println(myNum);</code>
          <p>Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value:</p>
          <p><b>Example:</b> Change the value of myNum from 15 to 20:<p/>
          <code>int myNum = 15;</code><br>
          <code>myNum = 20;  // myNum is now 20</code><br>
          <code>System.out.println(myNum);</code>
        
      </section>
      <br>
      <section class='main-section' id='Final_Variables'>
        <header>Final Variables</header>
        <p>If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, use the final keyword (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):</p>
        <code>final int myNum = 15;</code><br>
        <code>myNum = 20;  // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable</code>

      <section class='main-section' id='Other_Types'>
        <header>Other Types</header>
        <p>A demonstration of how to declare variables of other types:</p>
        <p><b>Example</b></p>
        <code>int myNum = 5;</code><br>
        <code>float myFloatNum = 5.99f;</code><br>
        <code>char myLetter = 'D';</code><br>
        <code>boolean myBool = true;</code><br>
        <code>String myText = "Hello";</code>
